# HandDigitIdentifier

The HandDigitIdentifier is a program which in its full functionality is able to detect and identify letters and numbers using a Keras model which can be both trained or loaded for the prediction.


#Prerequisites
The HandDigitIdentifier has been designed and tested in systems which support **Python 3.7 or above** and has not been tested with versions below so may have compatibility issues when using Python 3.6 and below.

The training of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) is done using **Keras** and **TensorFlow** which play the key role in optomising and learning of the DNN.
