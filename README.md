## Basic Description:

<span style="font-family:serif; font-size:16px;"> **The Hand Digit Identifier Program** is a program which in its full functionality is able to detect and identify letters and numbers using a Keras model. This model is to be trained in a specific dataset with desired parameters so that any user can use the model to perform predictions on custom data inputs. Furthermore this model can be saved and loaded at any later date. </span>

<pre>

1. Install the Hand Digit Indentifier Package

2. Install all required libraries and make sure reccomended python version is used

    >Also make sure your computer has enough space to download the MNIST dataset

3.  Run QMainWindow.py within the scripts folder

    >Running the project will create a main window GUI with all the subsequent options in the toolbar

4. Go File > Import Dataset > Choose the class of dataset you would like to use > Then click start importing

5. Wait for dataset to be installed onto your computer

    >When done the program should close out of the importing window

6. Finally, once the data has been installed you can view the photos/ train the model or save the model as you like
